# Webrubyrails2

A web app to create events and to add your name if you want to attend.

## Before you start

Check the result out at https://rails-events-s0553838.herokuapp.com/ to see whether it contains what you require. The current webapp is catering for the creation of events and includes the possibility to have users add their names for attendance. Advanced users are free to banter with the code and adapt it to their needs.

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment notes for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

You need Ruby 2.4.1 and Rails 5.1.6 installed.

## Installing

Fork the repository and clone it to your own local machine. If you have Ruby and Rails installed, change to the directory (`cd <directory>`) and type `rails/bin server` to run the server. You can now access the webpage at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Contributing

I'm happy to chat if you have any additional ideas or if you want to add some CSS to prettify the webapp!
